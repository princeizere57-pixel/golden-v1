      ["Mise en place first", "Stir-frying takes minutes, so everything is cut, measured and lined up by the stove before the heat goes on."],
      ["Heat the wok, then the oil", "Heat the empty pan until a drop of water skitters and vanishes, then add oil. Food sticks less and sears instead of stewing."],
      ["Small batches", "Crowding drops the temperature and steams the food. Cook protein in batches, set aside, and add back at the end."],
      ["Velveting", "Toss sliced meat with a little cornstarch, soy and oil for 15 minutes. It stays tender over high heat."],
      ["Sauce at the end", "Add a mixed sauce (with a pinch of cornstarch) in the last minute; it thickens and glosses everything at once."],

    focus: "Fermentation and dynamic balance",
    lessons: [
      ["The flavor triangle", "Gochujang (sweet heat), doenjang (deep savory) and soy sauce (salt) are the base. Most sauces mix two of them."],
      ["Balance on purpose", "Taste for spicy, salty, sweet, sour and nutty. Sesame oil and toasted seeds round the edges; rice vinegar lifts."],
      ["Fermented flavor fast", "Older, sour kimchi is perfect for cooking: fry it with rice, stew it, or add it to pancakes."],
      ["Banchan thinking", "Several small sides from one vegetable each: blanch, season with sesame oil, garlic and salt. Great for leftovers."],
      ["Rice is the canvas", "Rinse until the water runs nearly clear and rest it 10 minutes after cooking for separate, glossy grains."],

    focus: "Pan-sauce emulsification and pasta texture",
    lessons: [
      ["Salt the water well", "About 10 g of salt per litre. It's the only chance to season the pasta itself."],
      ["Save the pasta water", "The starch in it binds fat and liquid into a glossy sauce. Keep a cup before draining."],
      ["Finish in the pan", "Take pasta out a minute early and finish it in the sauce with a splash of pasta water, tossing hard."],
      ["Emulsify off the heat", "Butter and cheese go in off the heat; too hot and the cheese clumps or the sauce splits."],
      ["Fewer, better ingredients", "Most classic sauces use four or five ingredients. Let one lead and season to taste at the end."],
